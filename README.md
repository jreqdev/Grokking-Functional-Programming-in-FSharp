# Grokking Funcional Programming (F# examples)

[Grokking Funcional Programming (Michał Płachta, Manning 2022)](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-functional-programming) is a wonderful introductory book to functional programming. 

Code examples in the book are in Scala. Nothing wrong with that since the book doesn't assume previous knowledge of Scala (or basic Java), but I thought it would be a fun (no pun intended) exercise to try rewriting them into .NET and F# especifically. Code targets F# 9 soit  uses nice goodies introduced only relatively recently such as the [property shorthand feature](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-fsharp-8/).

So far chapters 01 to 08 are quite complete, while 09 is unfinished. Later chapters rely on the cats library quite a bit so we'll see how that goes as far as adapting the examples.

The F# source code contains comments and notes on what I found could be translated from Scala in a straightforward fashion and where alternatives needed to be found.

Comments and suggestions welcome!
